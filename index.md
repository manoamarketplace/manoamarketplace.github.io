Deployment

### Overview:
Provide a safe and simple way for students to buy and sell items on campus, giving students a chance to recycle and reuse campus-specific goods.

### Project goals:

* Students can search for goods they are looking to buy
* Students can list goods for sale
* Students can make offers on items and contact one another
* Admins can monitor site activity and report inappropriate behavior

### Mockup pages:
* Landing page
    * The landing page is the home page and the first page users will land on when they visit the top-level URL to the website.
* Sign-in and sign-up page
  * The sign in and sign up page is where the students can create an account to search for goods and list goods for sale.
* User home page
  * The user page is the page where the students will first see once logged in.
* Admin home page
  * The admin home page is where users with the “admin” role will have access. These could be UH Mānoa staff and faculty.
* Categories page
  * The categories page is where users can filter and find specific categories to search for items.
* Items listed page
  * The items listed page is where all listed items in the following category are shown.
* Create item page
  * The list item page is where the students can post items for sale. Items can be categorized, have a starting price point, and will include the date listed.
* Make offer on item page
  * Students are allowed to make offers on specific items, almost like a bid.
* Notify admin page
  * This page allows users to notify admins and report users in the case of post scams, explicit users, and bad behavior.
